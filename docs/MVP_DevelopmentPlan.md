### Implementation Strategy

#### **Development Order (Recommended)**
1. **Phase 7** (Easy Launcher) - Independent, low-risk, immediate value
2. **Phase 8** (Custom Instructions) - Builds on existing UI patterns
3. **Phase 9** (Model Selection) - Most complex, requires other phases as foundation

#### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Backward Compatibility:** All enhancements are additive with sensible defaults
- **Graceful Degradation:** Features work with fallbacks if APIs fail
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Each phase includes dedicated test coverage
- **Documentation Updates:** User guides updated with new feature documentation

#### **Quality Assurance**
- **Code Review:** All changes follow existing code patterns and architecture
- **Testing Requirements:** Maintain 90%+ test coverage on new functionality
- **Documentation:** Update user guides and API reference for new features
- **Performance Testing:** Ensure new features don't impact existing performance

#### **Success Criteria**
- **Phase 7:** Users can run/stop application with single command on any platform
- **Phase 8:** Users can add custom instructions that improve generated post quality
- **Phase 9:** Users can select from latest available models including future releases

This enhancement plan maintains the production-ready quality while adding significant value through improved usability, customization, and future-proofing capabilities.
